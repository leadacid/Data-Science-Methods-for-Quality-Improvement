# Applied Learning Project

Learners develop an understanding of how to manage, describe, and analyze continuous and discrete data using examples from business and industry. They explore how to assess processes for sources of variation through time as well as determine process capability with respect to customer requirements. Learners gain familiarity with the analysis procedures to assess measurement systems for continuous and discrete data in order to make decisions regarding the capability and acceptability of the measurement system. Assignments require learners to perform analyses for various data types and scenarios, interpret results, and make appropriate decisions.
